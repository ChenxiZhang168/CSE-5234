            Fans love to show their Buckeye pride but hesitate to spend over $100 on a jersey they'll wear once.
            GoBuckeye Jerseys offers a smarter alternative — rent or buy quality pre-owned jerseys for game days,
            handled with professional care and delivered with convenience. It’s pride made practical and sustainable.

                Our mission is to make showing Buckeye spirit simple, affordable, and sustainable for students. We provide 24–72 hour rentals and curated resale of quality‑checked, pre‑owned OSU jerseys with transparent pricing and reliable availability. Fans reserve online and pick up near campus; returns are streamlined via lockers or drop boxes, with next‑day cleaning handled by us. By maximizing reuse and minimizing waste, we help students look game‑day ready without committing to a $100+ purchase—while turning idle closets into inventory that benefits the campus community.

                We envision a campus‑wide circular wardrobe that pairs convenience with impact. Every jersey is tracked, cared for, and recirculated so fans spend less and the community wastes less. As we refine operations—inventory tiers, data‑driven pricing, and frictionless pickup/returns—we aim to partner with student organizations and campus venues to meet peak game‑day demand. Success looks like measurable dollars saved by students and garments diverted from landfills. We will grow responsibly, proving our model with OSU first and expanding only when unit economics and service quality stay exceptional.

            GoBuckeye Jerseys’ strategy is to achieve affordable fanwear sustainability through operational focus and data-backed decisions.
            We begin by concentrating solely on the OSU market—allowing tight control of inventory quality, pricing, and logistics.
            By combining locker-based pickup and returns, transparent quality tiers, and resale-driven supply, we ensure a scalable model
            that balances student convenience, profitability, and environmental responsibility. Once proven locally, this framework can be
            expanded to other campuses with minimal overhead and strong community partnerships.
